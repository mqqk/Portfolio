					<p>Where else to begin than with a picture of my family and me. I am a married man of 16 years with two beautiful sons. I live in Clayton, North Carolina. I have spent the last 14 years of my professional career proudly serving the public of Raleigh, North Carolina, but always with a peripheral interest in computer science.</p>
					<p>Throughout my career, hard work and the pursuit of constant improvement have been the crux oy my professional development. Unbeknownst to me when I began my career, my ability to continually work hard and improve set me apart from my colleagues. I pride myself on letting my work speak for itself.</p>
					<p>Early in my career, I attentively learned from my colleagues, applying the good and learning from the bad. The importance of collaboration and synergy grew from this experience. The team for which I was a part, was stronger and better if we worked together. This developed healthy and long-lasting friendships which will likely be with me the rest of my life.</p>
					<p>The combination of a strong work ethic and the experiential knowledge of the importance of collaboration give me the tools and ability to excel in my next career endeavor. I have always valued the philosophy "To be, rather than to seem to be" or "Esse Quam Videri". This means more to me today than ever. I do not pursue anything lightly. I dedicate myself fully toward my goals and have the integrity to assume responsibility if I fail.</p>

				<p>I am always astounded at the creativity and endless possibilities on the web. I am inspired to learn and expand my knowledge so that creating and expressing myself on this platform remains fun and intrinsic. Since 2010, I have found the open source world to be very inspiring. To know that there are those out there who strive to share and spread their knowledge to others in an effort to grow a community of open source for everyone is a great sentiment to carry into this profession. I am excited to finally be a part of that contribution.</p>

				<p>Over the years, I felt as though I missed my opportunity to contribute to the world of open source. Now I am faced with the great opportunity of embracing the open source community and collaborating with like minds to expand and creatively enhance it. I am thrilled and excited to join others in that expedition.</p>

            <p>I love gaming. My sons follow in my footsteps and we thoroughly enjoy our time together gaming as much as real-life experiences. Rocket League and Minecraft, each having a unique place in my heart, I enjoy for different reasons.</p>
			<p> Rocket League appeals to the competitive side of me and the desire to always improve. It also provides me a platform to show-off what I have learned and I enjoy pushing the limits of my ability to learn more.</p>
			<p>Minecraft sparks the creative side of me and taps into my intrinsic draw toward coding. Minecraft is one of the largest communities of open source. The creator always wanted it that way and I believe it was that ambition which makes Minecraft one of the most successful games in history. I can still get lost in it today after more than 10 years. My sons love it almost as much as me.</p>

			<h3 class="item">Ode to Code</h3>
			<div class="item">
				<img src="images/coding2.jpg" class="halfWidth" alt="coding picture"/>
			</div>
			<p>If we are marked to code, we are not to do our community loss; But to code, the more who share, the greater wealth of knowledge; Code’s will, I pray thee, wish another person more; I am not covetous of praise, nor care I who doth feed upon my ideas. It yearns me not if others my code they wear; Such outward things dwell not in my desires. But if it be a sin to covet brilliant code; I am the most offending soul alive! <sup>(recreated speech from Louis V, William Shakespere)</sup></p>
			<p>I bring creativity, collaboration, and the knowledge of the following fields: </p>
