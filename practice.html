            <p>I am always astounded at the creativity and endless possibilities on the web. I am inspired to learn and expand my knowledge so that creating and expressing myself on this platform remains fun and intrinsic. Since 2010, I have found the open source world to be very inspiring. To know that there are those out there who strive to share and spread their knowledge to others in an effort to grow a community of open source for everyone is a great sentiment to carry into this profession. I am excited to finally be a part of that contribution.</p>

            <p>Over the years, I felt as though I missed my opportunity to contribute to the world of open source. Now I am faced with the great opportunity of embracing the open source community and collaborating with like minds to expand and creatively enhance it. I am thrilled and excited to join others in that expedition.</p>
